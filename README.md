# Learn-WebGL
Start from 17/07/2018 :)

25/07/2018 Things have done:
1. Create animated geometry with material.
2. Switch scenes with click button function.
3. Load models from Blender.
4. Load models into HTML with css background.
5. Interactive function on models: click, mouseMove.

26/07/2018 Processing:
1. Solve the problem of animation. The animation seems only work on JSONLoader, so I decide to change all the models into JSON file.
